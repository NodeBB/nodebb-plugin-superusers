nodebb-plugin-superusers
===========================

Allows you to set a certain group of members to be superusers.

These users will not have access to the ACP but will have the ability to perform various advanced actions such as banning users from their profile page.

Plugins can extend the ability of superusers, see [the Squash plugin](https://github.com/NodeBB/nodebb-plugin-squash) for an example.
